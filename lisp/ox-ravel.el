   ;;; Commentary:
   ;;
   ;;              Several exporters are provided for translating from
   ;;              Org to formats for reproducible research using
   ;;              document generating engines such as Sweave, brew,
   ;;              knitr, rmarkdown, et cetera. Typically, R src blocks
   ;;              are converted to `code chunks' in the desired format
   ;;              and the rest of the Org document is translated to
   ;;              latex, html, markdown, or some other document format.
   ;;
   ;;              See ox-ravel.org in the orgmode-accessories archive on
   ;;              github for details.  Also see demos.org and other
   ;;              *.org files for examples of usage.

;; R markdown exports

;; The Markdown flavored exporters have a template that inserts a =YAML=
;; header at the top of the exported document. The ='ravel-markdown=
;; exporter is intended for the user.  It is derived from the ='rmd=
;; backend that adds options and a transcoder to the ='md= exporter. This
;; extra step is necessary since the macro ='org-ravel-define-backend'
;; does not add options or transcoders on its own.


;; The =`ravel-markdown= backend will extract all `YAML' export blocks
;; and combine their contents to form the yaml header.  The
;; `:with-auto-yaml-header' option controls automatic inclusion of the
;; author, title and date (from the corresponding =org= options) in that
;; block. Setting `rmd_yaml:header' in an options line will insert a yaml
;; header with title, author, and date before any other yaml lines.
;; Setting `rmd_yaml:footer' puts them after those lines. Since yaml
;; obeys `left-join' rules, the latter allows yaml export blocks to
;; override those settings.  Setting `rmd_yaml:nil' prevents those lines
;; from being inserted and if there are no yaml export blocks will result
;; in no yaml header being included.


;; By default ='ravel-markdown= (and ='rmd=) does (do) not produce a table
;; of contents as some output formats produce their own.  Setting
;; `:with-toc' to `t' will produce a table of contents in the =*.Rmd= file.

;; LaTeX style =\cite= directives are translated to Pandoc format in
;; ='ravel-markdown=.

;; The option =:with-biblinks= allows bibliography links to be processed
;; if such are defined and will allow citation links to be rendered by
;; =org-ref= if it is loaded.  Often one will want to place the
;; bibliography directives in a =YAML= export block, and the option
;; =biblinks:nil= will prevent superfluous insertion of a bibliography in
;; the =*.Rmd= file. Also, with =biblinks:nil= and =org-ref= loaded,
;; citation links will be rendered in =pandoc= =[@mycite]= style.

;; The ='ravel-markdown= exporter will produce [[https://quarto.org][quarto]] documents. The
;; ~.Rmd~ file extension that is produced by default can be changed to
;; ~.qmd~ by customizing the entry for ~md~ in `org-ravel-style-alist`.
